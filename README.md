# Building GraphQL Applications in Laravel

## ðŸš€ Overview

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that enables application-to-application communication and provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, making it easier to evolve APIs over time. GraphQL lets you ask for what you want in a single query by enabling clients to request their own unique data specifications, saves bandwidth, and reduces waterfall requests. In this course, Rasheeda Yehuza shows you how to set up a GraphQL in Laravel (PHP) using Lighthouse to query data.
